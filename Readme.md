A 1:1 replica of the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V moon rockets. It has the same realistic size, weight thrust and ISP and probably a bit OP for Kerbals.

It is highly detailed (custom low-poly mesh) with lots of textures, smoke and even lights for added effect. Not suitable for regular laptop users.

There are configs for Waterfall and Tweakscale

Currently there is a zip in the part folder which has much lower res images
